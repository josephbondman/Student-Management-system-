# Digital Attendance System

A console-based digital attendance system built in C++ to replace paper-based attendance taking in lecture halls.

## Features

### Student Management

- **Register students** with index number and full name
- **View all registered students** in a formatted list
- **Search students** by index number

### Attendance Session Management

- **Create lecture sessions** with course code, date, start time, and duration
- **Mark attendance** for all students (Present / Absent / Late)
- **Update attendance records** for individual students

### Reports and Summary

- **Attendance list** — view full attendance for any session
- **Summary counts** — see totals for Present, Absent, and Late per session

### File Storage (Persistent Data)

- Student records saved to `students.txt`
- Each session saved to `session_<CourseCode>_<Date>.txt`
- Data loads automatically on startup

### Using g++ (MinGW)

```bash
g++ -o attendance main.cpp
./attendance
```
